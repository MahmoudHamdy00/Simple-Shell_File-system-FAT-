# Simple-Shell_File-system-FAT-

This is a console application to simulate [Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing))

# Supported Commands
* `exit` : Quit the shell.
* `quit` : Quit the shell.
* `clr` : Clear the screen.
* `dir` : List the contents of directory .
* `help` : Display the user manual using the more filter and Provides Help information for commands.
* `md` / `mkdir` : Creates a directory.
* `rd` / `rmdir` : Removes a directory.
* `cat` : Concatenate FILE(s) to standard output.

*Currently, most of the commands use `system()` to execute the command, on the future I intend to implement it exactly without calling `system()`.*
